There two types of permissions in the Django framework.
a. Predefined/Default: CREAT(ADD)/Update/Delete/Read. CRUD
b. Customized Permision.

The steps to add permission/authorization to the applicatio/data model varies a bit
based on which type of the permission you are trying to add


(1) Add the customized permission to the "models.py". Make sure you run "makemiogrations" and "migrate" commands.
(2) Specify the permissions in the views.py
(3) Add the permission check to the templates.
